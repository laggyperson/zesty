But to add further, he knew that Fanny could understand only a few words taught to her by her owner, whereas Jeff understood every word of Russian and English that his parents had spewed.Shortly put, Jeff was confident in his knowledge. And he carried that intellectual superiority around with him at all times, which was the reason he now questioned the sight before him. You see, Jeff was aware of mirrors \u2013 unlike his furry cousin \u2013 and knew the land shark he saw in them was just a reflection of himself, but what he saw today, in his aunt\u2019s living room, was a land shark who did not look like him.Jeff took a step forward, while the other land shark simply stood. That settled it for Jeff, who could only come to one conclusion: another land shark stood before him! Even if his parents called him \u2018one of a kind\u2019, there was no other solution to be found; this one had a rough, black nose, and a comparatively small mouth for a land shark.

Jeff grinned. He had finally found another of his kind! In his aunt Yelena\u2019s house no less!

He asked the newcomer about others of the kind, whether they were related, and if he had more family out there, somewhere.\u201cOh, the land shark has found his surprise,\u201d Yelena\u2019s voice cut in before any response was given. It startled Jeff out of his inspection, but he didn\u2019t mind, instead bounding over to the Widow with the other land shark close on his heels. \u201cShe is a good land shark, yes?\u201d Yelena asked, and received profuse nods and thanks from Jeff. Simultaneously, the other land shark jumped up at the assassin, standing on her hind legs and pawing for attention. While Yelena indulged her with head scratches, Jeff sat patiently on the floor, quietly purring at his fellow land shark in order to teach her manners.\u201cGood shark, Jeff,\u201d Yelena praised. She pulled a pack of gummy sharks out of one of her many pockets and tossed a few of them in his direction. Jeff leapt and caught them all, swallowing them whole before he sat back down in the hopes of receiving more.

But the issue is that he\u2026 technically hasn\u2019t worked out his surprise.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?

        "completion": " Jeff was unique; he\u2019d never met another of his kind, and even among four-legged creatures he thought himself incomparable. Admittedly, even his experience of them was limited to a few bears he\u2019d met in the woods, and Fanny, but with that breadth of knowledge, Jeff assumed he must be smarter than the average mammal.The fact that he even knew what a mammal was, being evidence enough. But to add further, he knew that Fanny could understand only a few words taught to her by her owner, whereas Jeff understood every word of Russian and English that his parents had spewed.Shortly put, Jeff was confident in his knowledge. And he carried that intellectual superiority around with him at all times, which was the reason he now questioned the sight before him. You see, Jeff was aware of mirrors \u2013 unlike his furry cousin \u2013 and knew the land shark he saw in them was just a reflection of himself, but what he saw today, in his aunt\u2019s living room, was a land shark who did not look like him.Jeff took a step forward, while the other land shark simply stood. That settled it for Jeff, who could only come to one conclusion: another land shark stood before him! Even if his parents called him \u2018one of a kind\u2019, there was no other solution to be found; this one had a rough, black nose, and a comparatively small mouth for a land shark. As Jeff approached, it wagged its tail and lolled its tongue out of its mouth, grinning widely and exposing its short, blunt teeth.Jeff squinted and circled the creature; it had a split tail just like his, and a fin atop its back, plus four stout legs\u2026so perhaps it could be? Jeff grinned. He had finally found another of his kind! In his aunt Yelena\u2019s house no less! He wondered if she had brought it in \u2013 his parents did say she was skilled at finding rare things afterall \u2013 he would be sure to thank her later, and ask where she had found it.\u201cMrrrr?\u201d Jeff tested. He asked the newcomer about others of the kind, whether they were related, and if he had more family out there, somewhere.\u201cOh, the land shark has found his surprise,\u201d Yelena\u2019s voice cut in before any response was given. It startled Jeff out of his inspection, but he didn\u2019t mind, instead bounding over to the Widow with the other land shark close on his heels. \u201cShe is a good land shark, yes?\u201d Yelena asked, and received profuse nods and thanks from Jeff. Simultaneously, the other land shark jumped up at the assassin, standing on her hind legs and pawing for attention. While Yelena indulged her with head scratches, Jeff sat patiently on the floor, quietly purring at his fellow land shark in order to teach her manners.\u201cGood shark, Jeff,\u201d Yelena praised. She pulled a pack of gummy sharks out of one of her many pockets and tossed a few of them in his direction. Jeff leapt and caught them all, swallowing them whole before he sat back down in the hopes of receiving more. By the time he was back on the ground, Yelena had switched the gummy sharks for a much blander looking bone-shaped treat and was coaxing his land shark friend to sit, which she eventually did in return for the treat.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Eventually, you and Natasha found your way into the room, eyes widening at the two land sharks chasing each other around the room. Yelena sat in the middle, watching them with a smile on her face.Jeff skidded to a halt as soon as he noticed your intrusion, talking in quick \u2018mrrr\u2019s at you to explain the situation.Yelena also had a go at explaining, cutting in. \u201cThey were having a good time together.
