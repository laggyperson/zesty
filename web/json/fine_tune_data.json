        "completion": " Chapter 1: Saint\u2019s DayTony and they are decorated the night before the holiday. Tristan ask what was up with Nesreen going out there in the first place. Tony huffs out annoyed thinking about the quick way Steve got all uppity about dancing with Bucky (Snowflake). Rhodey asks how Tony is overall before the big first mission with the others. General holiday stuff.The fall colors started to come in as the tree began to lose the greens and get the reds and branches for the seasonal shift. Tony sat by the window curled still fuming at the change of plans for the mission that Mr. Righteous asshole thought was best for his best friend. Not like Tony will say he will be better, but changing the fucking plans because he danced with his best buddy is plain ridiculous.Not only is that annoying it was also embarrassing to have Rogers act like he was doing something horrible to the Winter Soldier. Dancing. That was it.He was dancing.Teaching those stupid bastards how to dance for a damn mission didn\u2019t even fucking matter at this point because Rogers changed the damn mission. Romanov may have known too. It pathetic as all hell that all American Dream thought this was the way to show he was a \u201cTeam player\u201dTony scoffed at the implications of this being their first mission after he comes back from the holidays. To think that was the thing.Even if he was uppity about his buddy dancing with Tony of all people\u2026 Tony couldn\u2019t help but to feel insulted. Upset even. He doesn\u2019t care that he put a tech guy but goes under his nose\u2026 to get thrown aside after getting his little sister involved even when she agreed.It felt like he wasted her time on a mission most of them weren\u2019t going to dance in. Wasted Rhodey's time getting his team ready.It was all so dumb. So idiotic. Damn pretentious he felt like saying.Staring out the window still of his mother\u2019s garden, Tony looked at the celebrations taking place for All Saint\u2019s Day. The family was here. Rhodey, Jennie, Nesreen, Tristan, Lilianna, and Mecili. Everyone. It was a great time. The kids are laughing and playing. Tony should feel great about it but the whole thing was grinding his gears.Standing up, he excused himself to the back with a warm cup of cofea, taking quick sips before throwing back the scalding hot drink, eyes trained on the sky. Zoning out, Tony didn\u2019t hear the back door open and close. The slow steps towards him, until the creaking of a bottom meeting the stairs, alerted him to another.Looking over to his left, Tony stared at his eldest cousin, his first by all accounts, brother. The older looked at the sky and than at him, \u201cWhat got you all pissy?\u201dHe loves straightforwardness but also hates to sit with a passion, \u201cThe mission, the first one our team has and Mr. Spangly ass pants changes it.\u201d\u201cOkay, that was the mission you asked Nes to come out for right?\u201dAlready the guilt came back like a bad kink in the shoulder, he looked to the window seeing his baby sister dancing with their family members and nodding. Frowning more at the very thought that he wasted her time still drew all his anger to himself and even more at his roommates from hell.\u201cTony,\u201d Tristan began as gold browns looked to the taller man, \u201cDidn\u2019t it go well? All of them know how to dance.\u201d\u201cIt did\u2026 besides a few hiccups but it went well. No, it is Rogers,\u201d He hissed out. Going behind a team member's back to change things because he doesn\u2019t like how it was planned out. Because what? He didn\u2019t trust others' opinions. Oh wait, Tony remembers.Fucking Siberia\u2026\u201cOkay, what did Rogers do this time?\u201d\u201cChange the damn plans. I know it is a little thing, and I should get over it but out of everything! The entire mission. He made it a solo team mission. \u00a0We don\u2019t know if the mission is going to be easy for one team! What if it goes left?\u201d Tony was beginning to boil, he didn\u2019t start a scene. He agreed but hell he wanted to argue, to point out the dangers. Yet another part of him, that suspiciously sounded like his life coach mentioned not everything needs to be an argument, sometimes it is better to let go.For whatever reason he let it go. Almost.Seeing his sister again in person reminded him of everything that happened.\u201cRight, but if it goes right? Will you still be pissed?\u201d\u201cNo, annoyed more like it. I just don\u2019t want anything to happen.\u201d\u201cOh? Is it because someone danced with a certain metal-armed beauty?\u201dTony coughed on nothing as he shoved Tristan playfully away, his cheeks feeling warm despite his cool demeanor, \u201cNo! I am like that with anyone. If people can avoid being hurt, all the better.\u201dTristan snorted with a laugh as he looked at the grey skies, the first few droplets of rain. His little cousin still fuming but had a more relaxed smile on his face. Whatever is going on Tristan is happy to know Tony can come back home to them now. Find the comfort he needs in loved ones.Tilting his head to the flower bed with fall blooming flowers, they both stood there looking at the plaque of a father and uncle long since passed. Tristan looked at the flower bed and Tony looked at it as well. Both were silent as they stayed there to remember him.The back door opened, and Nesreen's voice carried out, \u201cHey, dinner is ready you two! Mecili and Uncle Azan are about to eat all of it!\u201d The laughter rang true off her lips. Tony rolled his eyes fondly hurrying inside nudging Tristan to hurry.\u201cI am going to eat all the cookies!\u201dTristan hurried after the shorter man trying to beat him inside. Both get stuck and struggle to beat the other through the door. More laughter as the matron of the home helped them both inside. Tony hugged his mom and helped with serving the plates. Tristan followed them to the dining area. Hearing Tony talking to his momma, happy to be home for the holiday again.The pleased contentment between all the family felt warm. Stories shared. Laughter spreading joy among the Daws, Stark, Potts, and Rhodes. Under one roof enjoying each other presence.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t till late at night that Tony was watching a Broadway play on TV when he felt his little sister sit by him. Her cold feet slid under the unoccupied pillow. He took an extra blanket to wrap around Nesreen and himself tight to keep the chill off. The genius looked to the singing and dancing as he nudged her again, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d Nesreen looked at him cracking a yawn.Feeling his own yawn wanting to come, he shook the sleep from his head, \u201cFor helping me again with my dumb roommates, and sorry if it was\u2026 you know a bother.\u201d\u201cAntonio, no. Never,\u201d She started looking at him, scooting a little closer, she gave a small warm smile, \u201cYou are never a bother, goodness. I had fun teaching them. Even if they never use those skills ever again. I am happy to help you out.\u201d\u201cEven if only two of them are dancing?\u201d\u201cYep, my job is to teach not to see if I can get famous because some heroes used my lessons.\u201d She gave a small chuckle as they both hummed out the song.\u201cAlright.\u201dThe silence waned only for a minute, knowing themselves and each other well enough, Tony snorted at the thought, \u201cIt can be even since you teased me about the Winter Soldier.\u201d\u201cOh come on! That is so not even. I didn\u2019t even know you were going to ask him to dance the Tango, Tony the Tango!\u201d She whispered in outraged laughter, \u201cCome off it.\u201d\u201cLook you were the teacher, you should have stopped it.\u201d\u201cAnd you are a terrible T.A.\u201d She swung back. Both break short-lived stalemate with giggle fits. Tony breathed out through tears as he laughed more into his hands Nesreen started to mention, \u201cAnd your team face was hilarious when they saw you dancing. I had FRI save it for me and send it to me for the album.\u201dLaughing more, Tony and Nesreen looked at the photo of a shocked team. Rogers's face turns red. Barton's mouth hung open. Rushman eyebrows rose as she watched. Maximoff looking ready to kill him. But that is her default around him most of the time.It didn\u2019t negate the giggle fit the siblings found themselves in. It added when Tristan snuck in with treats from earlier in the night, as the three watched a dance fail compilation and people's faces in shock.^*^Coming back from the small vacation. Giving Jennie a big hug. Seeing Pepper and Happy later. Rhodey flying back to the compound, Tony found himself a little more level-headed. Looking at his phone, he felt his lips pull in a faint smile at the text sent from said Winter Soldier about Steve being surprised that he was gone for a minute.Another picture was sent to him of the big blonde asshole shocked face that sent a new wave of a giggle fit to him till he couldn\u2019t see past his eyes. Only guided memory as he laughed still, thinking about the upcoming mission faintly and how that would go.###STOP###"

That is the finest shit I have ever heard of.\u201d Mac laughs and takes a sip of her soda, nudging her best friend\u2019s shoulder. Ryn just nods vigorously, swallowing her own drink down.\u201cOf course,\u201d Eddie says. He plants a kiss on both their heads before pushing away from the counter and dropping down on the couch. When all he gets are blank stares from the two girls, he has to smile. \u201cGet over here.\u201d Mac almost instantaneously runs over, plopping down next to him and laying her head on his shoulder. The neck kisses return, mixed in with a couple of light bites.\u201cHow was your day, <em>Daddy</em>?\u201d Mac hums, nibbling on the lobe of his ear. He hooks his arm around the two girls\u2019 waists and pulls them a bit closer, giving a light smack to Mac\u2019s ass while he\u2019s at it.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stop calling me that?\u201d Eddie says, his voice low and raspy against the shell of her ear.\u201cOh, my bad. Must\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d Mac says, lightly licking along his jaw. \u201cWe wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d Eddie twirls a lock of Ryn\u2019s hair in his hand, the other caressing Mac\u2019s lower back. Ryn takes his hand from her hair and nuzzles her face against his palm.\u201cTell me.\u201d Eddie says. Something about his words, something in the tone\u2014 he already knew what they wanted. Just needed some add-ons per usual. Mac glances to Ryn, gesturing for her to start. It was amusing to see the two girls silently communicate.\u201cHave you ever heard of monster porn?\u201d Ryn asks. She spoke softly, almost flatly. Eddie has to pause and something rumbles in his chest\u2014 it isn\u2019t Eddie himself. There\u2019s a silent moment between the three, where Ryn and Mac are exchanging nervous looks. He was generally down for anything. \u2018As long as you two are here,\u2019 he\u2019d say. But he was so\u2026 quiet.\u201cYou okay, Ed?\u201d Mac asks, an awkward laugh rumbling in her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Ignore what we said. Anyways. What do you guys want for dinner? We have a lot of ingredie\u2014\u201d Eddie shakes his head, pausing Mac\u2019s sentence.\u201cLet him answer,\u201d Ryn says, giving Mac a knowing look. Mac gulps a little, nods her head and looks away with a slight blush on her cheeks.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it, yes.\u201d Eddie answers slowly. He\u2019s looking between the two girls now, trying to decipher where this is going. There\u2019s a million voices in his head. One of them is standing out. Ryn leans against him, her chest pressing against his as she wraps her arms around his neck.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Ryn starts off, her voice trailing into quiet. Mac shuffles around, clearing her throat with an anxious sigh. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we might need some new toys.\u201d Eddie nods, still grasping himself. He could throw these two down on his bed, show them what he\u2019s really hiding\u2014 no. He couldn\u2019t do that.\u201cAlright. We can do that.\u201d He says. Mac, uncomfortable as ever, stands and rushes towards the bedroom without a word. The door softly shuts behind her.\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d He tries to play it off. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything, sweetheart.\u201d He brushes a strand of hair from Ryn\u2019s face, who pushes his hand away. She looks kind of angry.\u201cDon\u2019t lie. Who have you been talking to?\u201d While Eddie is formulating an answer in his head, she pauses. \u201cActually, I think Mac should be here for this too.\u201d Ryn slides off of his lap and saunters over to their shared bedroom without another word, slipping inside quietly.\u201cYou should help me beat the shit out of him,\u201d she mutters. Mac\u2019s mouth twists into a frown. She pauses her music, taking out her headphones and setting down the tablet.\u201cWhat did he do now?\u201d She asks.\u201cI think he needs a good beating. He also won\u2019t tell me who he\u2019s been talking to.\u201d\u201cTalking to? What do you mean?\u201d Mac\u2019s face pales a little, the anxiety getting the best of her again. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s seeing somebody else?\u201d\u201cWould you like to hear why I think this?\u201d Mac nods, a slow bite of her lip accompanying it.\u201cThe first thing that stuck out to me was excessive eating. The second thing was the headaches he gets, which, granted, can be a side effect of his medication, but I don\u2019t think they are. The third reason was the muttering and the late night trips out,\u201d Ryn says lowly, leaning in to whisper to Mac.\u201cHe does a lot of mid-conversation pauses nowadays. Like something else is there, something else is talking.\u201d Mac murmurs. Before either Ryn or Mac can get another word out, there\u2019s a soft, hesitant knock at the bedroom door.It opens slowly, and Eddie peeks his head in with a nervous smile.\u201cCan we talk?\u201d###STOP###"
